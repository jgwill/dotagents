Our HOME/.agents for sharing and developping forks gently...

## Skill Sources

Skills here are authored manually and symlinked into `~/.claude/skills/` for Claude Code.

### mw-managed skills (not in this repo)

Medicine-wheel skills are distributed by the `mw` CLI, not stored here:

```bash
mw skill install   # installs to ~/.claude/skills/.mw/skills/
# then symlink up:
ln -s .mw/skills/<name> ~/.claude/skills/<name>
```

Current mw skills: `direction-inquiry`, `fire-keeper-check`, `wave-spec-generator`, `ceremony-guide`

MCP tool guidance is tracked at jgwill/medicine-wheel#73.
Migration context: jgwill/dotagents#7
